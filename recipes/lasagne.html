            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>

                <li>½ tsp dried thyme</li>
                <li>1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce</li>

            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat the oil in a frying pan over a medium-high heat. Add the onion and cook for 5 minutes, stirring
                    often,
                    until the onion softens.</li>
                <li>Add the garlic and cook for a further minute.</li>
                <li>Add the carrot and mushrooms and cook for a further 2-3 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add the minced beef and cook for 5-6 minutes, until browned. Stir often, breaking up any large
                    chunks of
                    meat with a spatula.</li>
                <li>Add the tomato puree, oregano, thyme, Worcestershire sauce, beef stock cube, tinned tomatoes, brown
                    sugar,
                    salt, and pepper. Stir and bring to the boil. Turn down the heat and simmer for 15 -20 minutes until
                    thickened.</li>

                <li>Meanwhile, preheat your oven to 200C/400F (fan) and start on the Béchamel Sauce:</li>
                <li>In a medium sized saucepan, add the butter and melt over a medium heat.</li>
                <li>Once melted and bubbling slightly, add in the flour and whisk it into the butter.</li>
                <li>Keep gently whisking the roux over the heat for one or two minutes to cook the flour. Add in a good
                    splash
                    of milk, turn up the heat and stir with the whisk to incorporate.</li>
                <li>Keep adding in the milk a good splash at a time, and whisking until all the milk is used up (this
                    normally
                    takes me about 3 or 4 minutes and I add the milk in about 5 splashes). Don’t worry if you get a few
                    lumps,
                    keep stirring with the whisk and they will disappear as the sauce thickens.</li>
                <li>Keep stirring the sauce with the whisk over the heat until your sauce thickens. Once thickened, add
                    in the
                    salt, pepper, and cheddar. Stir together and then turn off the heat.</li>
                <li>Spoon a couple of tablespoons of the meat sauce into the lasagne dish and flatten it so it covers
                    the base.
                    You don't need much – this is just to ensure the lasagne sheets don't stick to the bottom of your
                    dish. Then
                    cover with 4 lasagne sheets. Try to ensure they don’t overlap. You may need to break up one of the
                    sheets to
                    cover the dish fully.</li>
                <li>Spoon on a third of the béchamel sauce and spread it around to cover the lasagne sheets,</li>
                <li>Then cover with a third of the remaining meat sauce.</li>
                <li>Place a layer of lasagne sheets on top. Followed by a layer of béchamel sauce and meat sauce. Repeat
                    one
                    more time, until all of the sauce and lasagne sheets are used.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle the mixed cheese on top.</li>
                <li>Place in the oven and bake for 30 minutes until the cheese is golden and the lasagne is bubbling
                    slightly at
                    the edges.</li>
                <li>Take out of the oven and leave to rest for 5 minutes before sprinkling with parsley and serving.
